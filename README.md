# EngiOptiQA: Engineering Optimization with Quantum Annealing

**Please note:** _EngiOptiQA_ is currently in a very early stage of development. As the project progresses, documentation, additional features, and enhancements will be added. 

## Overview
_EngiOptiQA_ is a Python software library dedicated to **Engi**neering **Opti**mization with **Q**uantum **A**nnealing (QA). 
This project provides a set of tools to formulate engineering optimization problems suitable for QA.

To learn more about the background of _EngiOptiQA_ and the implemented problem formulations, please refer to the corresponding publication [[1]](#pub1).

## Citation

If you use _EngiOptiQA_ in your research or work, please consider citing it using the software's [DOI](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10222617) and the corresponding publication [[1]](#pub1).
